# GPS-Tracking-System
this project develops a GPS tracking system using TM4C123G LaunchPad, the system stores the moved trajectory after power-on until the distance exceeds 100 m which is the distention point,
the path can be a non-straight line,
the LCD displays the distance traveled while moving and off course the final distance after reaching the distention,
the build-in LED of the launchpad also turned on after reaching the distention.
