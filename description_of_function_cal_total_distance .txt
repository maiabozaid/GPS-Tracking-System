/****************Description of the function which calculates total distance*************************/ 
	
This function calculates the distance between two points which takes
 
the latitude and longitude of those points.It is used to calculate   
  
the distance between two locations using GeoDataSource(TM) products.

we will pass latitude_1, longitude_1 = Latitude and Longitude of point 1 (in decimal degrees)

and latitude_2, longitude_2 = Latitude and Longitude of point 2 (in decimal degrees).

the result will be in miles default and i convert it to meter by multiplying (1.609344*1000)

so the return value of function will be in meter

there are two functions one of them which converts from degree to radian (convert_deg2rad)

it will take degree and convert to radian 

and other function which converts from radian to degree (convert_rad2deg)

it will take radian and convert to degree.

in the main function:-

i need to do while loop to take every tow points to calculate the distance between them 

and we need to store the point2 in the point1 to make the function update the points 

the while loop will break if total distance greater than 100 or if i press the button 

the code of pressed button will invoke the function of it in the main function.
